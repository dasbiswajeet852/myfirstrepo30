Calculate the heat rate if steam enters a turbine at 400oF at atmospheric pressure and leaves the turbine at 200oF. Steam at 500 lb flows through the turbine each hour during normal operation.

Solution:

Given parameters are,

Ws = 500 lbs/hr

c = 0.48

Tin = 400oF

Tout = 200oF

ΔT = 400 – 200

ΔT = 200oF

We have the Formula,

Rh = Ws × c ×ΔT

 Rh = 500 × 0.48 × 200

Therefore,  Rh = 48000 btu/hr
